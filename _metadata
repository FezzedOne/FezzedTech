  "description" : "Includes scripts and tech that allow the use of my custom items as intended. For non-Steam downloads and [b]/spawnitem[/b] commands, go to the Discord server linked below.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Some parts of this mod require StarExtensions 1.9.11+, xSB xClient v1.0.4+ or starlight v1.0+. StarExtensions is available [url=https://github.com/StarExtensions/StarExtensions/releases]here[/url]; xSB is available through the linked Discord server; starlight is available [url=https://gitee.com/erodeesfleurs/starlight/releases]here[/url]. If you’re not on Windows, you can use xSB xClient, or use WINE to play starlight or Starbound with StarExtensions.\n\n[b]Redistribution and modification:[/b] You may freely redistribute or modify the mod and its associated items as you see fit. Just please make sure to credit me, alright?\n\n[b]Built-in commands:[/b] This mod adds four built-in commands for in-game dice rolling:\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]/roll:[/b] Rolls dice. Takes the following arguments: [b][dice] <is public> <comment>[/b]. Dice are in “dice + adds” format; both addition and subtraction are currently supported, but not multiple “adds” or other arithmetical operations. If you specify the die size as only [b]“d”[/b] (with no size number), it defaults to d6 (this is standard GURPS notation).\n[*] [b]/rab:[/b] Rolls dice multiple times and tallies them up. Takes the following arguments: [b][number of rolls] [dice] <is public> <comment>[/b]. Dice are in “dice + adds” format (see above).\n[*] [b]/ra:[/b] Makes a GURPS skill or stat roll. Takes the following arguments: [b][skill or stat value] <is public> <comment>[/b]. The skill or stat value is a simple integer; no arithmetic is currently supported. Critical failures and successes are handled as per standard GURPS rules.\n[*] [b]/raba:[/b] Makes multiple GURPS skill or stat rolls. Takes the following arguments: [b][number of rolls] [skill or stat value] <is public> <comment>[/b]. See above.\n[/list]\n\nThe last two [i]optional[/i] arguments to all the above commands are explained below:\n\n[list]\n[*][b]<is public>:[/b] Takes any of the following values: [b]false[/b], [b]true[/b], [b]local[/b], [b]global[/b]. If any other value is specified, this argument is skipped (defaulting to [b]false[/b]) and the value is parsed as a [b]<comment>[/b] instead (see below). If [b]false[/b], only you see the results of the dice roll. If [b]true[/b] or [b]local[/b], the roll is automatically posted in local chat. If [b]global[/b], it’s posted in global chat. If [b]party[/b], it’s posted in party chat.\n[*][b]<comment>:[/b] An optional comment for the roll which shows up in the roll message. Surround the argument with quotes if the comment has spaces in it.\n[/list]\n\nThe commands require xSB v2.0.0+, OpenStarbound or StarExtensions to work.\n\n[b]Uninstalling:[/b] Make sure not to have FezzedTech or any of the “empty” techs equipped before uninstalling this mod (or use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127561004]this mod[/url]).\n\n[b]Discord:[/b] https://discord.gg/S46Gk2t",
